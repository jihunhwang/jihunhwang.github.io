# You have finally reached the end of the internet!

Just kidding. My name is Jihun (I go by Jimmy). I am a Ph.D. student studying [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Hemanta Maji](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hmaji/).  
Last summer, I visited [NASA GSFC](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) ([Code 450](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/flight-projects-directorate/fpd-programs-and-projects/)) as a research intern hosted by [Alan Hylton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=toO5wnUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Before Purdue, I finished my Master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) where I briefly worked with Professor [Adam O'Neill](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/oneill/). Even prior to that, I did my undergrad in [Mathematics](https://www.math.umass.edu/) with a minor in [Physics](https://www.physics.umass.edu/) at the same institution, and I finished my senior thesis under the supervision of Professor [Panos Kevrekidis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~kevrekid/) ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panayotis_G._Kevrekidis)) on extreme wave events ([Abstract here](/Downloads/Hwang_Abstract.pdf)).

I am interested in any topics within or related to theoretical computer science. For now, let's say my biggest interest is [information-theoretic cryptography](https://itcrypto.github.io/), particularly leakage-resilient cryptography. I also like to talk about network algorithms, high-performance computing, and computer security, but not as much as I like cryptography.

I also play [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) sometimes as a member of [b01lers](https://b01lers.com/). If you are a student at Purdue interested in ethical hacking and offensive security, please consider joining us!
