I believe that his opinions are still valid for applied math students.

Basically a CS version of Tevelev's post above. If you are thinking of applying to Ph.D. programs in CS, please, do read this first (in fact, multiple times, especially Sections 3.5 and 5).

Please read this if you feel incompetent or powerless after an exam (or a semester). Don't be discouraged! <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-grades-and-exams-and-methods/">There's more to mathematics than grades and exams and methods</a>.

	<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2021/09/bias-math-sexism-racism/620207/">Math is Personal</a>. In case you do not understand why teachers are often called the engineers of human soul. Learning is very deep and students are too valuable to be just classified using some letters and numerics. 
</li>
	
<li>
	<a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/02/stem-intro-courses-humanites-exploration">Why won’t anyone teach me math?</a> I agree that a certain level of difficulty must be maintained in curriculums. However, systemically refusing to help or educate students is not a reasonable method of keeping that standard.

	I am a proud <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_generations#First_generation">naturalized first-generation American</a> (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america">Oath of Allegiance</a>)

	I was a huge fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miryo">her</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CL_(rapper)">her</a> music when I was in middle/high school. Also, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IU_(singer)">hers</a> too.

	Why do I love mathematics (⊃ theoretical computer science)? Watch this TED Talk <a href="https://youtu.be/Kc0Kthyo0hU"><i>What's so sexy about math?</i></a> by <a href="https://cedricvillani.org/">Cédric Villani</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani">Wiki</a>), 2010 Fields Medalist.

  <a href="https://youtu.be/0wv0gmmNl04">The Adventure of Alice and the Encrypted Message</a> by <a href="https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/">Allison Bishop</a>. The best introduction to modern cryptography for general audiences I have watched so far. Take a look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7j2qfr/growing_up_i_dreamed_of_being_a_writer_and_hated/">her AMA</a> as well!

	I have been practicing this: <a href="https://youtu.be/4Xp4F1h0YZM">How to pronounce German Mathematician's Names</a> (cw: swearing and memes). I am still struggling but I have gotten way better though.
